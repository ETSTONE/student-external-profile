    summary: |
     I am someone that looks for new challenges. My adaptability has allowed me to do things like teach English in Egypt and Japan to both children and adults alike.
     I currently educate people about Social Security and what their options are depending upon what stage they are in their lives. I am looking for my next opportunity to progress.
